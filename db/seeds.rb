# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# User.create(name: "Alice")


# data = [
#     {
#         "name": "NYC",
#         "hotelName": "Mariott",
#         "address": "123 1st St",
#         "check_in": "11/11/11",
#         "check_out": "12/11/11",
#         "comment": "Comment",
#         "image": "Image_URL",
#         "user_id": 1
#     }

# data.each do |booking|
